====================================
|| Nujabes Tribute Project
====================================

-------
Design
-------
The main body of the page is spread across a total of 4 true columns and 24 rows using CSS Grid.
I say 'true' columns because one is used as a center line. All of the images and captiosn were layed
out according to the appropriate column starts and ends.

The center 'line' of the timeline was created using an empty column with a small width
and a black color fill.

---------------
Future features
---------------
I'm going to add an animation at the top of the page to show that 'Nujabes' is an anagram of 'Jun Seba'

I'm going to build a simple 'beat maker' or 'loop maker' or something to that effect and make
use of a library like howler.js or something similar.
